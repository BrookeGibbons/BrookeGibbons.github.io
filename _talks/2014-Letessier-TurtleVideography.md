<strong>Abstract</strong>

Studying sea turtles when they leave coastal areas is a particular challenge for research and conservation. As part of a large-scale fish monitoring programme, we have deployed mid-water stereo baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVS, Letessier et al. 2013) at 181 sites around northwestern Australia. From 27 turtle observations, we identified 11 green turtles (<em>Chelonia mydas</em>) around Dirk Hartog Island, west of Shark Bay (April 2012) and three olive ridley turtles (<em>Lepidochelys olivacea</em>) on the Australian shelf of the Timor Sea (September 2012, Fig. 1). Turtle encounter rates were 37 % inside the shallow Dirk Hartog pass (mean depth 11 m) compared with 0 % on the seaward side of the island, and 2.5 % in the Timor Sea (mean depth 113 m). Straight carapace length (SCL) was measured for one olive ridley (70.0 cm, an adult female) and four green turtles (SCL =40.6â€“89.5 cm). At least two olive ridleys and three greens actively inspected the bait (see electronic supplementary material).
