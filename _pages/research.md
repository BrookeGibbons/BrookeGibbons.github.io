Many cetaceans were hunted down to the brink of extinction during the 20th century. It is thought, for instance, that whaling stations in Australia and New Zealand had killed over 40,000 humpback whales by the time their operation ceased in the mid-1960s. Some populations have begun to recover, but not all have done so at a comparable pace, and many now face additional threats from incidental catch in fisheries to vessels strikes. Abundance and population trend estimates are still largely lacking, hampering effective management and understanding of  

I have produced a abundance estimates for a number of dolphin and whale populations along the West Australian coast, using mark-recapture and distance sampling methods.

<h2>Distribution models</h2>

Snubfin dolphins (Orcaella heinsohni) are coastal and estuarine cetaceans endemic to northern Australia. Only discovered in 2005, the species remains very poorly known and little
information currently exists on the animals’ distribution, habitat preferences, behaviour or Snubfin dolphins preferences, behaviour or abundance. Local populations have been identified in Queensland and Western Australia but these are likely small and geographically or genetically isolated. In 2010, a nomination was made for the listing of snubfin dolphins as a threatened species under the EPBC Act, based on its known biological characteristics and the rising threats it faces from coastal developments and industrial activities.
