<h2>Model transferability</h2>

Predictive models have become ubiquitous in ecology, where they are used to understand where and why species occur, and what impacts anthropogenic change may have on biodiversity. Very often, the need for model predictions is highest in systems, areas, or time periods where little or even no biological knowledge currently exists. Models that can produce accurate and precise predictions when transferred into these novel conditions are both highly desirable and of great utility for conservation and management.

I am co-leading projects on the topic of model transferability with colleagues from the University of Salford (UK) and the University of Western Australia.

<h2>Ocean sampling</h2>

Pelagic protected areas have undergone exponential growth on a global scale in response to concerns over the footprint of human activities on the world's oceans. Assessing their performance in protecting biodiversity requires innovative tools that can not only detect a wide range of often elusive, mobile organisms but are also cost-effective, reliable, and non-invasive.

A significant part of my research to date has centred around the development and application of baited underwater camera technology to conduct surveys of ocean wildlife in remote, offshore areas characterised by complex seafloor terrains.

<h2>Conservation biogeography</h2>

Despite its size, ecological importance, and the plethora of ways in which it is exploited, the pelagic ocean remains drastically unfamiliar to science and chronically under-explored. Documenting and mapping the distribution of biological diversity is crucial to delineating

<h2 class="researchtitle">Abundance estimation</h2>

Many cetaceans were hunted down to the brink of extinction during the 20th century. It is estimated, for instance, that whaling stations in Australia and New Zealand had killed over 40,000 humpback whales by the time their operation ceased in the mid-1960s. Although some populations have begun to recover, not all have done so at the same pace, and many still face significant threats from human activities such as incidental catch in fisheries. In this context, abundance and population trend estimates are critically needed for management, but remain largely lacking.

I have produced abundance estimates for a number of dolphin and whale populations along the West Australian coast, using a combination of mark-recapture, line transect sampling, and spatial modelling methods.

<h2>Spatial ecology - northern Australia</h2>

Snubfin dolphins (<em>Orcaella heinsohni</em>) are coastal and estuarine cetaceans endemic to northern Australia. Only discovered in 2005, the species remains poorly studied - with limited information on patterns of distribution, habitat use, behaviour, or abundance. Similarly, the Timor Sea is an important - but data-deficient - reservoir of marine biodiversity that faces rising human impacts. This dearth of information undermines ecological monitoring and the implementation of effective management interventions.

I am involved in collaborative projects aimed at predicting the distribution of dolphins and other marine vertebrates at regional scales across remote tropical areas.
