<h2>Cetacean abundance</h2>

Due to its long history of exploitation from the whaling industry, the population of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) known as southern hemisphere breeding stock ‘D’ has one of the longest records of study and management. These animals migrate annually from high-latitude feeding grounds in Antarctica to tropical breeding grounds in the Kimberley region of northern Western Australia (WA). Because of their primarily coastal distribution, migrating humpback whales rapidly became vulnerable to hunting during the 20th century. It is estimated that whaling stations in Australia and New Zealand killed over 40,000 humpback whales during their time of operation, effectively bringing the species to the brink of extinction by the time their commercial harvesting ceased in 1963. Since the International Whaling Commission moratorium on commercial whaling came into place in 1986, many whale populations have however begun to recover, although not all have done so at the same pace. The first efforts to monitor stock D humpbacks began in Shark Bay in the 1990s. Aerial surveys showed that ca. 11,500 individuals were found of the WA coast by 1999, and that numbers were rapidly increasing (from 12,800 in 2005 to 33,850 in 2008). The aim of this project was to (1) update population estimates with new aerial survey data gathered from the same population at North West Cape, a site located approx. 400 km north of Shark Bay, and (2) define a possible trend in abundance from the combined results gathered at both locations.
