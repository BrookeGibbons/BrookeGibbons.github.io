<h1 class="aboutPhil">About Phil</h1>

I am a jack of a few trades – initially trained as a marine mammalogist, I morphed into a shark/fish/anything-that-lives-under-the-sea biologist as a doctoral student. At heart though, I am just an obstinately geeky data cruncher, who always gets a kick out of playing with numbers.

My research broadly spans the field of quantitative ecology, and I have a keen interest in the use of GIS and statistical methods to address pressing wildlife conservation problems. My work so far has focused on a range of marine taxa (fishes, sharks, turtles & cetaceans), habitats (coastal, pelagic), approaches (empirical, simulation, theoretical), scales (local, regional, global), and bioregions (temperate, tropical).

My <a href="http://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/submarine-topography-as-a-predictor-of-mobile-predator-hotspots-relevance-and-applications-to-conservation-planning-in-the-pelagic-ocean(b0d4da3f-49bd-404f-bd73-0b5dfbcc2746).html" target="_blank">PhD study</a> looked at ‘hotspots’ of mobile marine predators, and how these align with prominent physical features of the ocean floor such as seamounts, <a href="https://phbouchet.github.io/publications/2017-Bouchet-SAUHotspots">submarine canyons</a>, or offshore shoals and banks. It also involved the development of a new generation of <a href="https://phbouchet.github.io/publications/2015-Bouchet-BaitedVideography">midwater baited underwater video cameras</a> to film endangered oceanic sharks in deep-water environments.

I am currently based at the University of Western Australia, and act as an Associate Editor for the journal <a href="http://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)2056-3485/" target="_blank" >Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation</a> and Review Editor for the Marine Megafauna section of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science" target="_blank">Frontiers in Marine Science</a>.

In collaboration with colleagues from UWA, the University of Salford and Queensland University of Technology, I am currently co-leading studies on the topic of <a href="https://phbouchet.github.io/publications/2018-Sequeira-TransferringBiodiversity">model transferability</a>, with the aim of assessing when, and why ecological models may/may not make reliable predictions of species distributions in unsampled environments.
