<h1 class="aboutPhil">About Phil</h1>


I am a <a href="http://www.nespmarine.edu.au" target="_blank">NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub</a> Postdoctoral Research Fellow based at the <a href="http://www.meeuwig.org" target="_blank">Centre for Marine Futures</a>, University of WA in Perth, Australia.

In my <a href="http://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/submarine-topography-as-a-predictor-of-mobile-predator-hotspots-relevance-and-applications-to-conservation-planning-in-the-pelagic-ocean(b0d4da3f-49bd-404f-bd73-0b5dfbcc2746).html" target="_blank">PhD thesis at UWA</a>, I examined the value of seafloor topography (submarine canyons, offshore banks and shoals) as a proxy for hotspots of mobile vertebrates in pelagic environments. In that context, I helped develop a new generation of midwater baited underwater video cameras that can be used to record and monitor endangered oceanic species in deep-water habitats. The camera systems have since then been used all over the globe by international initiatives including <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/projects/pristine-seas/" target="_blank">the National Geographic Society's Pristine Seas Programme</a>. In my MRes thesis at the University of St Andrews, I generated an updated population size estimate for the Western Australian humpback whale breeding stock based on aerial survey data.

I have a keen interest in spatial ecology, GIS and ecological statistics as they relate to modern wildlife conservation problems, and I strive to come up with creative data displays to unravel stories that can inform on-the-ground ocean management. My research broadly spans the field of quantitative ecology, with a focus on a several marine taxa (fishes, sharks, turtles & cetaceans), ecoregions (coastal, pelagic), methods (empirical, simulation, theoretical), spatial scales (from local to global), and systems (temperate, tropical).

In collaboration with colleagues from UWA, the University of Salford and Queensland University of Technology, I am currently co-leading studies on the topic of model transferability, with the aim of assessing when, and why biodiversity models do/don't make reliable predictions of species distributions in unsampled environments.
