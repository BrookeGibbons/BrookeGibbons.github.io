<strong>Abstract</strong>

Limited resources and increasing environmental concerns have prompted calls to
identify the critical questions that most need to be answered to advance conservation, thereby
providing an agenda for scientific research priorities. Cetaceans are often keystone indicator species
but also high profile, charismatic flagship taxa that capture public and media attention as well
as political interest. A dedicated workshop was held at the conference of the Society for Marine
Mammalogy (December 2013, New Zealand) to identify where lack of data was hindering
cetacean conservation and which questions need to be addressed most urgently. This paper summarizes
15 themes and component questions prioritized during the workshop. We hope this list
will encourage cetacean conservation-orientated research and help agencies and policy makers to
prioritize funding and future activities. This will ultimately remove some of the current obstacles
to science-based cetacean conservation.
