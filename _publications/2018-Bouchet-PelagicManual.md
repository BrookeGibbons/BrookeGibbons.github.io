excerpt: 'This report provides standard operating protocols for marine sampling using pelagic stereo-BRUVS (baited remote underwater video systems). We offer a step-by-step guide on everything from pre-survey planning to equipment preparation, field procedures, and on-board data acquisition - in an effort to develop consistent and transparent guidelines that can support standardisation across sites, studies and institutions.'

<strong>Abstract</strong>

With over 70 contributors from 30 agencies, the NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub has developed a suite of field manuals to describe a nationally consistent and defensible approach to marine data acquisition. This manual relates to pelagic (mid-water) BRUVS, i.e. gear designed to acquire digital video imagery of macro-organisms living in the oceanâ€™s water column, from small zooplankton to marine mega-vertebrates. It aims to provide a step-by-step guide on everything from pre-survey planning to equipment preparation, field procedures, and on-board data acquisition to guarantee the efficient and correct use of pelagic BRUVs, particularly for use as monitoring tools in Australian Marine Parks (AMPs) and other Commonwealth waters. Such information is critical for supporting the development of consistent, concise, transparent and standardised guidelines in the collection and processing of pelagic BRUVS data that can allow statistically robust comparisons between studies, sites, projects, and institutions.
